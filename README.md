# Predicting FGM and Rape Vulnerability
# Objectives
* Develop a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of being subjected to Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).
* Take into account demographic factors such as age, gender, education, income, location, poverty, low education, cultural beliefs, exposure to violence, and other risk factors to make predictions.
* Provide a tool that can be used to identify and target interventions towards those at the greatest risk of FGM.

# Data Selection
* The data used was obtained from publicly available sources such as surveys or reports on FGM prevalence and risk factors. 
* The selection of variables used in the model may have been guided by prior research on FGM and risk factors associated with the practice. 
* Additionally, the selection of variables may have been based on the availability and quality of data on these variables in the source datasets.

# Data Cleaing
* `Handling missing data`: This involved imputing missing values using techniques such as mean imputation, median imputation, or k-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation.
* `Handling outliers`: This involved removing or transforming extreme values that are not representative of the data distribution.
* `Handling inconsistent formatting`: This involved converting categorical variables to numerical representations, normalizing data units, and standardizing variable names.
* `Handling duplicates`: This involve identifying and removing duplicate records or merging duplicate records to create a single representation.
* `Feature scaling`: This involved scaling numerical features to have the same range or normalizing them to have a standard distribution.


# Feature Engineering Involved
* The variables for income, education, and location were converted into categorical variables with integer labels. This involved mapping income ranges to integer values, or converting location data into a binary variable representing rural or urban areas.
* Additionally, the input data for gender was converted into a binary variable with 0 representing female and 1 representing male.
* Some feature scaling or normalization was performed on the input data, although this is not evident from the code provided. Overall, the feature engineering involved in the project likely involved some data preprocessing and transformation to prepare the input data for use in the predictive model.
# Data Model Used
* A `Random Forest model` was used for making predictions
* A `linear regression model` was also used for making predictions
# Model Deployment
The model was loaded from a saved file and used to make predictions on input data within a Streamlit app.

# `app.py`
This is a Streamlit app for predicting the vulnerability of female genital mutilation (FGM) based on input parameters such as age, gender, and education level. The app uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of FGM vulnerability indicators to make predictions.

#### To run the app, execute the script in a Python environment with the required libraries installed. The app will launch a `Streamlit interface` with input sliders and drop-down menus for selecting the input parameters. Click the `"Predict"` button to generate a prediction for the given input parameters.

# How to use the app
1. Open the script in a Python environment
2. Install the required libraries using pip
3. Run the script
4. The Streamlit app will open in your web browser
5. Use the sliders and drop-down menus to input the required parameters
6. Click the "Predict" button to generate a prediction
# Example Usage
Suppose a 25-year-old female with a secondary level of education wants to predict her vulnerability to FGM. The user would input the following parameters:
```
Age: 25
Gender: Female
Education: Secondary
```
After clicking the `"Predict"` button, the app would generate a prediction for the user's vulnerability to FGM based on the input parameters.

# Testing the app
To test the app, you can try different input parameter combinations and observe the predictions generated by the model. You can also test the app by comparing its predictions to the actual FGM vulnerability indicators of a population.

# Limitations
The app's predictions are based on a machine learning model trained on a specific dataset of FGM vulnerability indicators. Therefore, the app's predictions may not be accurate for populations with different characteristics or for predicting FGM prevalence rates in different countries.

# Code Demonstration
The code loads the trained model and defines a function to preprocess the input parameters and generate predictions using the model. The app's interface is defined using Streamlit's sidebar and widgets, and the app's functionality is implemented in the main function. To run the app, execute the script in a Python environment with the required libraries installed. <br/>

The `predict function` preprocesses the input parameters and generates a prediction using the trained machine learning model. The app's interface is defined using `Streamlit's sidebar` and `widgets`. The `main` function defines the app's functionality, including making predictions using the predict function and displaying the prediction to the user. When the user clicks the `"Predict"` button, the app generates a prediction for the input parameters using the predict function and displays the result to the user using the `st.success` function.

# `prediction.py`
 *This is a simple web application built with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of an individual being vulnerable to Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) based on their demographic information. The prediction model was trained using a Random Forest Classifier algorithm and takes into account factors such as age, gender, and education level.*

 # Prerequisites:

* Python 3.6 or above
* Streamlit
* Pandas
* Numpy
* scikit-learn

# Instructions for running the prediction model:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required packages by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the command below to start the Streamlit app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
5. The app should open in a web browser. You can then input the required demographic information and click on the "Predict" button to see the predicted outcome.
`Note:` The current model is a prototype and may not provide accurate predictions. Please use it for educational purposes only.
